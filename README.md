Real-Time Sign Language Translation System


Overview

This project is an innovative real-time sign language translation system leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning and computer vision techniques. The system can translate sign language gestures into text and perform real-time grammar correction, making it highly useful for enhancing communication accessibility.

Features
Data Collection: User-friendly process for compiling custom sign language datasets.
Model Training: Neural Network model incorporating LSTM and Dense layers with an accuracy of 0.95 for gesture recognition.
Real-Time Processing: Integration of MediaPipe Holistic for precise hand tracking and gesture prediction.
Grammar Correction: Real-time grammar correction using the language_tool_python library.
Deployment: Web application using Flask and Flask-SocketIO for translating audio and sign language.
Advanced Techniques: Utilization of ensemble methods and transfer learning to boost model performance.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
Flask
Flask-SocketIO
MediaPipe
TensorFlow
speech_recognition
language_tool_python
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
نسخ الكود
git clone https://github.com/mennaahmedhosany/Real-Time-Sign-Language-Translation-System.git
cd sign-language-translation
Create a virtual environment:

bash
نسخ الكود
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
نسخ الكود
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application:

bash

flask run
Usage
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000.
Choose between audio and sign language translation.
For sign language translation, allow webcam access and start signing.
For audio translation, allow microphone access and start speaking.
The translated text and corrected grammar will be displayed in real-time.
